  # Project 3 â€“ SIRI 1.0.
 This program is a prototype program for SIRI. 
  This program will begin by asking the user (within a loop) to make selection from a menu.
  Note: The program will only display a demo playing the song playlist created and the weather information response is not live and accurate.
